# Springboot web API for bulk lookup of phonenumbers on (gulesider.no, tbd....)
- Build tool : Maven
- Scraper/HTML parser : jsoup (https://jsoup.org/)
- Testcases written with Junit, MockMvc and Mockito found under `src/test/java/.*`
- docker-compose.yml to easily set up a postgres image to use with the application
- Using the JDBC API, no JPA
- No db interaction in endpoints exposed by LookupController
- PhonebookController has all endpoints that interact with a db

## Response Formats

### 1) Single LookupRecord Json  
  ```json
    {
      "phoneNum": "12345678",
      "identity": "Jane Doe",
      "company": false
    }  
   ``` 
### 2) Json Array of LookupRecord
```json
    [
  {
    "phoneNum": "234234",
    "identity": "John Hancock",
    "company": false
  },
  {
    "phoneNum": "22303031",
    "identity": "N/A",
    "company": false
  },
  .....
]
   ```

## Endpoints
- [x] `GET : api/lookup/{number}`
  - Single lookup of given number
  - Response format 1(add link)
- [x] `POST : api/lookup/list`
  - Lookup of all the numbers in the request body
  - Request body should be a json array of numbers e.g `[12345678,24235555, ...]`
  - Response format 2 (add link)
- [x] `POST : api/lookup/upload`
  - Expects a 'text/plain' `.txt` file, one phone number per line
  - Response format 2 (add link)
-[x] `POST: /api/db/lookup/save`
  - Does a single lookup and saves the result to the db
- [x] `POST : /api/db/insert`
  - Insert a phonebook record into the database
  - returns the record with generated timestamp but w/o the autogenerated pkey
  - (Should change to return rows inserted OR with the pkey but requires verbose rewrite)
- [x] `GET : /api/db/all`
  - All rows in the database
- [x] `GET : /api/db/all/{number}`
  - All rows for the given number
- [x] `GET : /api/db/latest/{number}`
  - Gets the most up-to-date row for the given number
- [x] `DELETE : /api/db/delete/old/{number}`
  - Deletes records with the given number except for the most up-to-date row
  - Responds with number of rows deleted


## How to run
- `git clone https://github.com/elektroluse/Ringding.git`
- `cd Ringding`
- `docker-compose up`
  - (!) If you have a local postgres service running on the same port as defined in `docker-compose.yml`
  - You will run into issues, change the port or pause the service
- `./mvnw spring-boot:run`
  - Make API calls with Postman or write a program that sends HTTP requests to the endpoints available 

## TODO
  - Add PhonebookRecord json representation to readme
  - Refactor DTOs properly (LookupRecord should probably not be in service package)
    - Ringding and the scrapers should probably also be moved to a separate directory
    - "LookupService" with a ringding dependency would be cleaner
  - Refactor PhonebookController test
  - Implement sensible restrictions
    - Rate limiting
    - Validate that input string is numeric AND follows the E. 164 international standard (? maybe)
  - tbd
  - (?) DB lookup before external lookup
  - Build and run instructions
  - Usage examples
